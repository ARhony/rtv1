# How?
```
git clone path rtv1_folder
cd rtv1_folder
make
./rtv1
```

# Next?
It's not easy to change the scene settings, you need to go inside init.c file and change the parameters. More event will come soon like a click on a shape or the posibility to choose the 3D shape. Just a better way to create the scene you want.
